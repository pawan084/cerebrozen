# CereBro — TODO / Known Debt

> Prioritized output of the full-codebase review (2026-07-02), updated after the
> implementation pass the same day. Check items off as they land; re-run a review pass
> periodically. Companions: [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md), [TECHNICAL.md](TECHNICAL.md).

## Open — needs the owner's accounts/credentials (no code left to write)

- [ ] **Rotate any previously shared provider keys** (OpenAI/Deepgram/ElevenLabs) and the
  Phase-0 items in RELEASE_PLAN.md (shared VPS/root passwords, shared SECRET_KEY).
- [ ] **Apple Developer portal:** enable the Sign in with Apple capability for
  `com.cerebrozen.app` (the app now ships the entitlement + `CereBro.entitlements`;
  set `APPLE_CLIENT_ID` in prod env).
- [ ] **Apple Developer portal:** add the HealthKit capability to
  `com.cerebrozen.app` (entitlement + `NSHealthShareUsageDescription` shipped
  2026-07-03; simulator works without it, physical-device builds need the App ID
  capability).
- [ ] **Google Sign-In:** create the OAuth client; add `GIDClientID` + reversed URL scheme
  to Info.plist and `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` server-side.
- [ ] **App Store Connect:** create `com.cerebrozen.premium.monthly` +
  `com.cerebrozen.premium.annual` (₹3,999) + `com.cerebrozen.premiumhuman.monthly` +
  `com.cerebrozen.premiumhuman.annual` (₹11,999), point Server Notifications V2 at
  `POST /webhooks/appstore`. (Annual SKUs are code-complete client+server side
  2026-07-03 — investor gap #3.)
- [ ] **Ops config:** `SMTP_*`, `TWILIO_*`, `OPS_ALERT_EMAIL`, `APNS_*`, and `ASC_*`
  GitHub secrets (TestFlight workflow).

## Open — code/product work

### Ref-mock audit follow-ups (ref/ design screens, audited 2026-07-07)
- [x] Backend + Android: program enrollment (`/programs` router + `program_enrollments`
  table, Alembic `0b8e5d2f7a41`; day computed from start date) — "PROGRAM · DAY X OF 7"
  Home card + enroll/leave on Programs. Device-verified; suite 250 passed / 95 %.
- [x] Backend + Android: Pattern Dashboard (`GET /insights/patterns` honest 60-day
  derivations w/ per-source consent gates + `DELETE /users/me/memory` chat/insights/
  Oracle-checkpoint wipe) — You → Pattern dashboard screen.
- [x] Android: Daily Plan route (step toggles + regenerate), Search route (whole
  catalogue), immersive live-voice session overlay (timer/state/End/Text),
  first-run guided tour (4 stops, `tour_done` pref).
- [x] iOS + web ports (2026-07-07): iOS — RemoteProgram/RemotePatterns APIClient
  endpoints, Home ProgramProgressCard, ProgramsView real enroll/leave, Pattern
  dashboard (You row), GuidedTourOverlay (gated off under `-resetState` so
  UITests stay deterministic; build + Home UITests green). Web — /patterns page
  (+account link), programs enroll/active banner, Home journey card, GuidedTour
  overlay; e2e journey extended (tour walk/skip, enroll → Home card, patterns
  empty state + delete-memory round-trip) — full docker e2e suite green.
- [ ] Proactive stress detection (ref Home card: Watch HRV → "start 2-min reset") —
  blocked on HealthKit capability/portal (owner) + needs the paired-Watch feature bet.

### Sleep tracking module — validated GO (2026-07-03), plan in [SLEEP_TRACKING.md](SLEEP_TRACKING.md)
Ordered for delivery; framing rule everywhere: non-diagnostic "sleep awareness", no
accuracy/staging claims (App Store 1.4.1 + 5.1.3, AASM position).
- [x] Backend: `sleep_logs` table (Alembic `9e8d4f7c2b65`) + `/sleep` router
  (upsert-by-date, range list, weekly summary: avg duration, bedtime consistency,
  quality trend, `enough_data` gate) + 7 tests — 2026-07-03, suite 184 passed /
  95.68 % coverage; migration verified on a fresh DB; live-API smoke-tested.
- [x] iOS: morning sleep check-in (Home row + Sleep tab CTA→edit row), 7-day trend
  strip (real data only, 3-night honesty gate), diary history — local-first
  `SleepEntry` in `AppState`, mirrored to `/sleep`, demo-seeded under `-resetState`
  (today left unlogged so the CTA stays deterministic). 2026-07-03: build green,
  Sleep+Home UITests pass incl. new save→diary assertion.
- [x] Content: CBT-I-informed wind-down guide as `/content` items (new `wind_down`
  kind: model docstring + admin CMS + iOS renderer + local fallback) and Sleep-tab
  rails (stories/soundscapes/meditations) now server-driven with `Dummy` fallback;
  seed is additive-by-title so new items reach existing dev DBs. 2026-07-03:
  backend 185 passed / 95.68 %, live `/content?kind=wind_down` verified, admin
  tsc clean. Home rails + search migration still open (item below).
- [x] Insights: server weekly insights now compute a real Sleep metric (avg duration,
  "No diary yet" empty state) + a sleep × mood note only when the week's own data
  supports it (both buckets ≥2, gap ≥0.5). 2026-07-03. iOS *local* fallback insights
  still show illustrative strings (labeled) — honest-local computation is follow-up.
- [x] Plans/nudges/Oracle: fallback planner protects the wind-down after short/rough
  nights (LLM prompt also carries the diary summary); `wind_down` nudge anchors
  ~45 min before the user's own average bedtime (timezone-aware, upserts in place);
  `log_sleep` Oracle tool + `sleep_checkin` widget kind wired backend + iOS in the
  same commit. 2026-07-03: 190 passed / 95.72 %.
- [x] v1.5: HealthKit sleep read (opt-in, off by default) — entitlement +
  `NSHealthShareUsageDescription`, `HealthKitSleep` read-only manager, check-in
  toggle + pre-fill (user still confirms; `source: healthkit` flows to the server),
  PRIVACY_LABELS row updated. Never writes to HealthKit; no PHI in iCloud.
  2026-07-03. Portal App ID capability = owner item above.
- [x] Instrument licensing CHECKED (2026-07-07): both are paid-license for
  commercial products — **PSQI** © U. Pittsburgh (free non-commercial only;
  commercial license via Pitt Office of Technology Management; no modifications
  without written permission); **ISI** © C.M. Morin, distributed by Mapi
  Research Trust/ePROVIDE (license agreement + user fee for commercial use;
  translations via Mapi/ICON). Verdict: keep NOT shipping either verbatim — the
  own-wording plain-language 1–5 baseline stays (details + sources in
  [SLEEP_TRACKING.md](SLEEP_TRACKING.md) non-goals). Owner: license via
  Pitt/Mapi only if a validated instrument ever becomes a product requirement.

### Strategy-doc adoptions (2026-07-03) — remaining decisions/work
- [x] **Analytics vs "no trackers" promise** — DECIDED + shipped 2026-07-04:
  first-party anonymous counts on our own Postgres, zero third-party SDKs.
  `product_events` table (Alembic `b17c4e8f2a93`) + `POST /events` (allowlisted
  names, random install id, endpoint takes NO auth so rows can't join accounts)
  + `GET /admin/metrics/funnel` + admin funnel chart; iOS `Analytics.track`
  (onboarding steps, paywall view/CTA; no-ops under `-resetState` and when the
  new "Anonymous usage stats" toggle in Privacy & Memory is off); privacy
  policy/labels/landing copy reconciled (PRIVACY_LABELS now declares Product
  Interaction, not-linked). Unblocks experimentation.
- [x] Email one-time-code (passwordless) sign-in — 2026-07-04: `login_codes` table
  (Alembic `af3e6b9c1d57`) + `POST /auth/otp/request` / `/auth/otp/verify`
  (find-or-create like Apple/Google, marks email verified, clears password
  lockout; single-use, 10 min TTL, burns after 5 wrong tries; hashed at rest);
  iOS AuthForm "Sign in without a password" flow (`.oneTimeCode` AutoFill) +
  web-app signin code mode. Passkeys deferred to v2.
- [x] Contextual baseline capture — 2026-07-04: `BaselineCheckView` (two 1–5
  scales) offered as a Home row once ≥3 mood check-ins exist and no baseline yet;
  `setBaseline` stamps the date once; Insights "Your starting point" renders again.
- [x] Companion persona picker — 2026-07-04: "Companion style" row in You →
  `CompanionStyleView` (4 styles, default Calm Guide), persisted locally and
  synced to the server profile (`PATCH /users/me companion`; re-applied on
  connect; server value adopted on a fresh install still at the default).
- [x] 90-second onboarding (one-tap state → breathing reset → mini-plan → account)
- [x] Consent private-by-default (no pre-ticked toggles + recommended card)
- [x] Language moved before the value moment

### Design refresh — "Newsreader warm" system (ref/ mockups, 2026-07-05)
Implementing the Claude-designed refresh in `ref/` across iOS + web (Android later).
The `ref/` HTML mockups are the target; `uploads/ios-screens/*.jpg` are current-iOS
renders used as design input. Decisions locked with owner: full token evolution,
responsive sidebar + mobile-tab web shell, full web auth parity (Apple+Google+email+OTP),
sequence tokens → web onboarding/auth → web shell/screens → iOS polish → landing.
- [x] **Phase 1 — token + type foundation (2026-07-05):** warmed the shared palette
  (`design/tokens.css` → synced to all `globals.css`; iOS `Theme.swift` Brand mirror):
  night `#080b22`→`#0e0c22`, periwinkle `#6f7bf7`→`#8a7bf0`, ink→`#1c1740`, amber→coral
  `#f0a48c`, rose→`#e08a9a`, mint→`#7ee0a8`, added `--warm`/`--cyan`. Web headings
  Georgia→**Newsreader** via `next/font/google` (self-hosted at build — CSP-safe;
  `--font-serif` with Georgia fallback) in `apps/{app,web}`. Warmed the hardcoded rgba
  glows/backdrops + OG/favicon generators. `apps/app` build green (Newsreader woff2
  self-hosted, 10 routes). iOS keeps its native New York serif (platform Newsreader-alike).
- [x] **Phase 2 — web onboarding + auth (2026-07-05):** ported the iOS 10-step funnel
  to `apps/app/app/onboarding/page.tsx` (value-first: age gate → AI disclosure →
  language → one-tap state → CSS breathing reset → goal-derived first plan → signup →
  private-by-default consent → reminders → Enter). Draft collected locally
  (`lib/onboarding.ts`) and applied to the server after the account exists
  (attest + consent + profile/motivations/goals + email-nudge opt-in). Shared
  `components/AuthPanel.tsx` (web port of iOS AuthForm): **Sign in with Apple +
  Continue with Google** (via `lib/social.ts`, SDKs loaded only when
  `NEXT_PUBLIC_{GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID,APPLE_SERVICES_ID}` set — inert-but-honest
  otherwise, CSP-clean by default) + email/password + passwordless OTP. Gating
  mirrors iOS (`hasOnboarded` in localStorage; `/` gate → onboarding|signin|home;
  `/signup` redirects into the funnel; returning sign-in marks onboarded). Build
  green; Playwright walkthrough screenshots verified all 10 steps render on-brand
  (warm palette + Newsreader, one-tap consent flips the 4 pattern toggles). Closes
  the standing "Google sign-in" web item. Owner still needs the OAuth client ids to
  make the social buttons live.
- [x] **Phase 3 — web app shell + screens (2026-07-05):** rebuilt `apps/app`
  `(authed)/layout.tsx` as a responsive shell — left **sidebar** on desktop (Menu:
  Home/Talk/Sleep/Journal/You + Explore: Insights/Plan/Library + Sign out) and a
  floating **bottom pill tab bar** on mobile (< 900px), per `CereBro Web.dc.html`.
  Extracted a reusable component library: `components/icons.tsx` (inline SVGs, CSP-
  clean), `components/ui.tsx` (PageHeader, HeroCard, Panel, SectionTitle, Row, Chip,
  WeekDots). Rebuilt **Home** to the hero-card design (gradient mood check-in card,
  streak week-dots, "Keep going" rows); the other authed screens inherit the new
  shell + warm palette + Newsreader. Verified end-to-end: brought up db+api, created
  a real account through the funnel, screenshotted the authed shell at desktop
  (sidebar) + mobile (bottom tabs) with live streak/name data. Build green (15 routes).
  Follow-up (optional): per-screen hero rebuilds for Talk/Sleep/Journal/Insights.
- [x] **Phase 4 — iOS refresh + polish (2026-07-05):** the warm palette propagates
  through tokens — audit found **zero hardcoded hexes** outside `Theme.swift` +
  `SplashView`, so every screen moved with the palette. `xcodebuild` green (iPhone 17
  Pro sim, iOS 27); launched + screenshotted Home — warm indigo/purple gradient, New
  York serif headings, hero card + streak orb + floating tab bar all render on-brand.
  (The funnel + auth already matched the ref pre-refresh.)
- [x] **Phase 5 — landing refresh (`apps/web`, 2026-07-05):** landing already carried
  the warm palette + Newsreader from Phase 1; the phone hero screenshot was the last
  stale (cool) asset — regenerated `public/screens/home.webp` from a fresh warm iOS
  Home capture (640×1391 webp), so the hero now matches the warm page. Warmed the
  OG/favicon generators earlier (Phase 1). Follow-up: `journal-entry.webp` +
  `sleep-player.webp` showcase thumbnails still show the old palette — regenerating
  them authentically needs an XCUITest nav pass (simctl can't tap; Simulator ran
  headless), deferred as low-priority (below the fold).

### Design refresh — open follow-ups
- [x] Logo adoption (2026-07-05): adopted the **C-ring + orb mark**, warm-recolored to the
  palette (lavender→cyan ring, warm-lavender orb; the vector has no "eye" dot — that was
  raster-only). New warm SVGs `apps/web/public/brand/{cerebro-mark,cerebro-lockup}.svg`
  (Newsreader wordmark). Reusable inline `BrandMark` in apps/web (`components/BrandMark.tsx`)
  + apps/app (`components/icons.tsx`) — landing nav/footer + app sidebar now show the mark.
  iOS: rendered a warm 1024 opaque app icon (flattened RGB, App-Store-safe) → `AppIcon`,
  and a transparent tight mark → `BrandLogo`; `SplashView.OrbMark` no longer circle-clips
  (open ring). Warmed the `LaunchBackground` (#0e0c22) + `AccentColor` (#8a7bf0) colorsets
  (asset colorsets Phase 1 missed). Verified: web builds green + nav mark on-brand; iOS
  builds green + new springboard icon confirmed. OG/favicon deliberately kept as the warm
  orb (the mark's orb element — reads better at 16-32px, avoids satori path limits).
- [x] Marketing banners re-rendered (2026-07-05): all four (App Store feature 1024×500,
  social/OG 1200×628, hero 1920×1080, story 1080×1920) rebuilt with the warm palette, the
  new C-ring mark + Newsreader wordmark, and the current warm app UI (Home / onboarding /
  splash), replacing the kit's old-UI device shots. Live in `apps/web/public/brand/banners/`.
- [x] Per-screen web hero rebuilds (2026-07-05): Talk (AI-disclosure note + serif header),
  Sleep (violet "This morning" hero), Journal ("Release the day" prompt hero), Insights
  (weekly-headline hero + metric bars) all rebuilt with PageHeader + HeroCard + SectionTitle,
  data logic untouched. Build green; screenshotted signed-in against live backend.
- [x] Refresh the two landing showcase thumbnails (2026-07-06): sleep-player + journal
  regenerated from the warm iOS build so the showcase matches the warm-refreshed hero
  (all three screens now one palette).

### Web app v1 + admin v2 — plan in [WEB_APP_PLAN.md](WEB_APP_PLAN.md)
- [x] Infra prep (2026-07-03): `apps/app` Next.js scaffold (:3002), CORS origin added
  (dev default + env examples), Caddy `app.cerebrozen.in` block, dev/e2e/prod compose
  services, CI typecheck job. Design tokens: third CSS copy for now (per-app Docker
  contexts) — extraction still open below.
- [x] Auth client with `POST /auth/refresh` rotation (2026-07-03): app keeps the access
  token in memory + refresh in localStorage with one rotation retry per 401; admin
  upgraded to the same pattern (sessions no longer die at 30 min).
- [x] Web v1 first slice (2026-07-03): signup/signin, Today (mood check-in + recent),
  Journal (composer/history + crisis-support banner on elevated risk — never blocks),
  Sleep diary (check-in, honest weekly summary, history — closes SLEEP_TRACKING #6).
- [x] Web v1 features (2026-07-03): chat (Oracle SSE fetch-streaming w/ tool-confirm
  + crisis banner, `/chat` fallback + chips), plan (optimistic step toggle,
  regenerate), insights (5 real metrics + upcoming nudges), account (consent,
  region, trusted contact, export download, typed DELETE). Found + fixed a real
  backend bug on the way: first `/oracle/messages` on a fresh DB hung forever —
  langgraph's `setup()` runs `CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY`, blocked by any
  idle-in-transaction pool connection; the graph now warms in the app lifespan
  pre-traffic, with a 30 s setup timeout falling back to MemorySaver.
- [x] Library page (2026-07-03): served `/content` catalogue grouped by kind on the
  web app; honest "playback lives in iOS" footnote.
- [x] Dead-decoration sweep (2026-07-07): Programs now fetches the real
  `GET /content?kind=program` catalogue (hero mirrors the first program; CTA →
  `/plan`); Games gained a genuinely playable box-breathing game (reuses the
  onboarding `.onb-breathe` CSS + phase logic); Sleep soundscapes/stories fetch
  `/content?kind=soundscape|sleep` (dead PLAY buttons removed); Plan + Library
  restored to the EXPLORE nav (were built but orphaned). e2e app spec asserts the
  real program title (grid-card h3 — the hero h2 mirrors it, so `getByText` was
  ambiguous), Start→Stop breathing, and Plan/Library reachability. 11/11 e2e green.
- [x] Home "Today's plan" wired to `GET /plans/active` (2026-07-07): renders the
  served agentic steps (sorted by order; done steps show ✓/DONE/strikethrough and
  link to `/plan`, undone rows deep-link by step symbol — wind→Games, moon/bell→
  Sleep, book/brain→Journal, mic/person/heart→Chat, else `/plan`); quiet
  "Open today's plan" fallback row only on fetch failure; "Open full plan →" link.
  e2e asserts ≥2 real step rows (LLM titles vary, so shape not text; the error
  fallback renders exactly one row, keeping the assertion honest). 11/11 green.
- [x] Web v1 remaining: Google (+ Apple) sign-in — done in the Design-refresh Phase 2
  (2026-07-05) via `components/AuthPanel` + `lib/social`; buttons are live once the owner
  sets `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` / `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPLE_SERVICES_ID`.
- [x] Shared design tokens — 2026-07-04: canonical `design/tokens.css` +
  `scripts/sync-tokens.mjs` rewriting marker-delimited blocks in all three
  `globals.css` (checked-in copies stay Docker-friendly); CI drift gate
  (`--check`). Union palette reconciled (web `--card` 0.05 → 0.045).
- [x] Streaks on web (2026-07-03): `GET /users/me/streak` computes the "mindful days"
  streak server-side (same one-grace-day rules as iOS — now a cross-stack contract);
  Today page shows the streak card + week dots. iOS still computes locally
  (offline-first) — keep the rules in sync.
- [x] Playwright spec for the web app in the existing `e2e/` stack (signup → check-in →
  journal → sleep → reload survives via refresh rotation). 2026-07-03.
- [x] Admin v2 (2026-07-03): first-party Analytics tab (`GET /admin/metrics/overview` —
  DAU/WAU/MAU, signup-cohort D1/D7/D30 retention, activation funnel, 7-day engagement;
  aggregates only, no per-user browsing) + per-user support view (`GET /admin/users/{id}`
  — counts/consent/last-active; journal/chat/sleep contents never cross the endpoint,
  test-pinned).
- [x] Nudge authoring (2026-07-03): `POST /admin/nudges` (one user or all active,
  kind `announcement`, delivery via the existing scheduler) + `GET /admin/nudges`
  (kind-filterable) + admin Nudges tab. Admin v2 complete.
- [x] Stripe web billing — 2026-07-04: `services/stripe_billing.py` (httpx REST +
  manual HMAC webhook verification, no SDK), `POST /billing/checkout` (503 until
  `STRIPE_*` set) + `POST /webhooks/stripe` → same `subscription_tier` contract;
  account-page "Upgrade" button degrades honestly. Owner: create Stripe products +
  webhook endpoint + keys.
- [x] Email nudges for web-only users — 2026-07-04: `users.email_nudges` opt-in
  (Alembic `d41f6a8c2e95`, account-page toggle); `dispatch_due` falls back to
  email when there's no push token and the user opted in.
- [x] `/auth/apple` Services-ID audience — 2026-07-04: `APPLE_SERVICES_CLIENT_ID`
  accepted as a second token audience (web button itself still needs the owner's
  Services ID + Apple JS wiring).
- [x] Web Push (VAPID) — 2026-07-07: `web_push_subscriptions` (Alembic `e52a9c7d3b81`)
  + `/users/me/push-subscriptions` (status+key GET / register POST / unregister
  DELETE; endpoint unique — a shared browser notifies whoever subscribed last) +
  `services/webpush.py` (pywebpush, RFC 8291 encrypted payloads; 404/410 endpoints
  pruned in place). `dispatch_due` preference: native push → browser push → email
  opt-in → honest `skipped`. Keys are a self-generated VAPID pair (`npx web-push
  generate-vapid-keys`; no third-party account — owner sets `VAPID_*` in prod env
  — verified in-container that base64url strings roundtrip); keyless = the
  account-page toggle disables with an honest note (e2e-pinned) and delivery logs.
  apps/app: `public/sw.js` (push + deeplink click-through), `lib/push.ts`,
  account-page "Browser notifications" toggle.
- [x] Oracle agent consent — verified 2026-07-04: the graph's system prompt embeds
  NO user data; its only data read (`get_weekly_insights`) delegates to the already
  consent-gated `insights.compute_weekly`, and every write tool is individually
  user-confirmed via `interrupt()`. Nothing left to gate.

### Investor-readiness actions — benchmarks + full list in [INVESTOR_READINESS.md](INVESTOR_READINESS.md)
- [x] **Decide analytics** — done 2026-07-04 (see the strategy-doc item above):
  first-party anonymous events + admin funnel shipped; D1/D7/D30 + activation
  already came from `metrics/overview`; the funnel adds pre-account steps.
- [ ] Annual subscription SKUs + 7-day-trial design; treat the first-session paywall as
  the primary experiment surface (89.4 % of trial starts happen Day 0).
- [ ] Financial model anchored to IN/SEA benchmarks ($14 Y1 LTV/payer, 15.2 %
  trial-to-paid) with US distribution + ₹1,499 tier as blend-up levers.
- [ ] Clinical-credibility package: named clinical advisor, cite conservative dCBT-I
  meta-analytic effects, write up the crisis-safety design as a diligence artifact.

### DPDP Act readiness — checklist + deadlines in [DPDP_COMPLIANCE.md](DPDP_COMPLIANCE.md)
Substantive obligations bite **13 May 2027**; SPDI Rules 2011 (mental-health data =
sensitive) apply **today** and are already satisfied. Ordered by lead time:
- [x] Consent screen itemised — 2026-07-04: `journal_memory` + `sleep_history` flags
  (Alembic `c29d5f7e4b18`) across backend model/schemas + iOS Consent/Privacy screens +
  web account page; every category now ENFORCED at its read site (chat recall, plan
  signals `agentic._recent_signals`, weekly insights) — previously only `ai_memory` did
  anything. Oracle context gating is still open (below).
- [x] Rule 8(3) deletion ledger — 2026-07-04: `deletion_ledger` (hashed email +
  account age only, written in the same transaction as the cascade delete; ops purge
  after 12 months). Content still hard-deletes instantly.
- [x] Grievance contact published — 2026-07-04: grievance@cerebrozen.in + 90-day SLA +
  Board-escalation note on the web privacy policy and the in-app policy screen.
  (Owner: create the mailbox.)
- [x] Breach-notification runbook — 2026-07-04: [BREACH_RUNBOOK.md](BREACH_RUNBOOK.md)
  (roles, statutory clock incl. CERT-In 6 h today, templates, preparedness checklist).
- [ ] Processor security clauses with LLM/voice/email/SMS vendors (Rule 6(1)(f)) —
  **prepared 2026-07-07**: per-vendor table + 6-point clause checklist drafted in
  [DPDP_COMPLIANCE.md](DPDP_COMPLIANCE.md) §4; what's left is pure owner execution
  (accept each vendor's self-serve DPA, archive the PDFs, record the no-training
  settings) before 13 May 2027.
- [ ] DPIIT startup recognition (eligibility for the s. 17(3) exemption if an SDF class
  notification ever covers wellness apps).
- [x] Localize consent/notice screens — 2026-07-07: a "notice language" picker ON
  each consent surface (DPDP s.5(3) — iOS onboarding ConsentScreen + PrivacyView
  via `Trust/ConsentNotice.swift`; web onboarding consent step + account page via
  `apps/app/lib/consentNotice.ts`; the two files are a hand-synced cross-stack
  contract). English + the 12 most-spoken Eighth-Schedule languages (hi bn te mr
  ta ur gu kn ml or pa as); defaults follow the app-language step (Hinglish →
  English — Latin script). e2e asserts the हिन्दी re-render on the account page.
  OWNER before 13 May 2027: professional review of all translations + the
  remaining 10 languages (Bodo, Dogri, Kashmiri, Konkani, Maithili, Manipuri,
  Nepali, Sanskrit, Santali, Sindhi); full privacy-policy translation is separate.

### Onboarding flow review (2026-07-02) — smaller findings
- [x] Back navigation — 2026-07-04: back chevron on every step > 0 (`StepScaffold`
  `onBack` + `OnboardingBackButton` on the custom screens); UI test covers it.
- [x] Notifications step single-select — 2026-07-04: `ChipRow(singleSelect:)`,
  inert "Private previews" option removed.
- [x] Age gate — 2026-07-04: under-18 exit ("I'm not 18 yet" → honest message +
  Childline pointer); confirmed-at persisted (`AppState.ageConfirmedAt`) and sent
  with `attest()` (server honors past client times, caps future clocks).
- [x] Consent toggles pre-checked on — fixed 2026-07-03 (private-by-default).
- [x] `FirstPlanScreen.planTitle` sparse mapping — now covers 6 goals + calm default.
- [x] `OnboardingProgress` accessibility value — 2026-07-04: label + percent value;
  baseline date now stamps once (`setBaseline` keeps the original date).

- [x] iOS imagery — 2026-07-04: ALL remaining remote Unsplash URLs removed
  (`Dummy.Img.*` and the server seed's `image_url` are now empty); every hero/
  rail renders the branded gradient + symbol well `Photo` already draws. Zero
  network images: offline-correct, private, App-Review-safe. Bundle real
  licensed art via the CMS/asset catalog if it ever lands.
- [x] Remaining `Dummy` catalogue — 2026-07-04: Home rails (time-matched kinds
  from `backend.catalogue`, sleep-goal bias preserved), Programs (`kind=program`
  + new "Stop overthinking" seed item), Search (whole served catalogue as the
  pool) all server-first with the curated local fallback offline; UI tests
  stay deterministic (`loadCatalogue` no-ops under `-resetState`).
- [x] Backend test isolation — 2026-07-04: conftest now runs the suite in a
  dedicated `<db>_test` database, dropped + recreated fresh per run (active
  whenever DATABASE_URL is set, i.e. container + CI); dev data stays untouched
  and create_all can never race the dev DB's Alembic state again.
- [x] VoiceOver for streaming chat — 2026-07-04: the live bubble is marked
  `.updatesFrequently` ("CereBro is replying") and the completed reply is
  announced once via `UIAccessibility.post` — deliberate: per-token speech is
  noise, one announcement is the accessible pattern.
- [x] Opt-in live-LLM suite — 2026-07-04: `tests/test_live_llm.py`
  (`RUN_LLM_TESTS=1` + a key: real /chat reply + Oracle SSE liveness; skipped
  hermetically otherwise). Verified live: 2 passed against real keys.
- [ ] **Android app** — slices 1+2 shipped 2026-07-04: zero-SDK API client
  (auth + refresh rotation), live Today/Journal/Sleep/Talk tabs — ALL verified
  end-to-end on an API-35 emulator against the dev backend (sign-in as the
  seeded demo user, check-in advanced the server streak 3→4, journal + sleep
  writes landed, /chat returned a live LLM reply with suggestion chips).
  Gradle wrapper now committed (./gradlew just works). Warm design refresh
  applied 2026-07-06: `Color.kt` mirrors the warm tokens (indigo night #0e0c22 +
  warm-lavender accent #8a7bf0 + coral/cyan/ok), so every token-driven screen
  recolored at once — emulator-verified Today/Talk/Sleep in the warm palette,
  matching iOS/web. Feature parity round applied 2026-07-06 (all emulator-verified
  against the dev backend): (1) onboarding funnel — welcome → 18+ attest → AI
  disclosure → language → state-check → breathing reset → account → consent →
  notifications; (2) You/Settings depth — live consent toggles (GET/PATCH
  /users/me/consent), data export, account delete, crisis link, sign out;
  (3) new destinations off a Home quick-grid — Insights (/insights/weekly bars),
  Programs + Sounds (/content by kind), Games (live box-breathing), Crisis
  (offline directory + trusted-contact status). Audio + Sleep round 2026-07-06:
  a real MediaPlayer with a bundled ambient bed (res/raw) + a now-playing
  transport wired into Sounds and the Sleep "Wind down" library; Sleep gained a
  live 7-night bar chart (shows at ≥2 nights) — emulator-verified (dumpsys:
  MediaPlayer state:started @16 kHz). Voice + prompt round 2026-07-06: the Talk
  tab is now a real voice companion — an orb driving on-device SpeechRecognizer →
  /chat → TextToSpeech (keyless; RECORD_AUDIO runtime-requested; degrades to text
  where no recognition service exists) — emulator-verified (mic permission →
  cyan listening orb → AudioService recording); Journal gained a rotating
  prompt hero ("Try another"). iOS-interface-parity round 2026-07-06: the You tab
  is now the iOS ProfileView nav-row hub (profile header "name · companion ·
  language" + rows) with new sub-screens — Companion style (4-persona picker →
  PATCH /users/me companion), Privacy & memory, Daily reminder, Premium plan,
  Crisis region (→ PATCH region), Human support, Privacy policy, Export, Delete;
  Games gained the iOS 5-4-3-2-1 Grounding tool. Emulator-verified (You hub +
  companion picker). Fix-all-possible round 2026-07-06: Today's plan card on Home
  (/plans/active); a transparent offline read-cache in the API client (GET
  responses cached, served on network failure — emulator-verified cold-start in
  airplane mode; also fixed refresh() so a network blip no longer signs the user
  out); a real local daily-reminder notification (AlarmManager + channel +
  POST_NOTIFICATIONS, no FCM — dumpsys-verified); a playable Bubble-pop game.
  Polish round 2026-07-06: the C-ring brand mark now ships as the adaptive
  launcher icon (rendered to density buckets + adaptive-icon XML — no more default
  robot), an in-app Canvas BrandMark (onboarding + a brief branded splash), fade
  screen transitions, and haptics on bubble-pop + mood chips. Polish round 2 (all
  emulator-verified): the Newsreader variable font now ships (res/font, wired into
  Type.kt display/headline); quick-grid + You nav-row icons (material-icons-
  extended); a real background-audio FOREGROUND service (AmbientService +
  MediaSession + MediaStyle transport notification with play/pause + lock-screen
  controls — dumpsys-verified category=transport); content-rise page entrance;
  drifting bubbles; and more haptics (companion/region select, tab switch, check-in
  confirm). Remaining polish nice-to-haves: custom (non-Material) brand icon set,
  ambient background motion on Home/Talk. Remaining (genuinely blocked): per-track NARRATED
  audio (needs the content pipeline to serve audio URLs — today every title
  shares the ambient bed), Home HealthKit/Health-Connect card (heavy native).
  Auth round 2026-07-06: passwordless email OTP now fully works
  (/auth/otp/request+verify — emulator-verified end-to-end, new account created);
  "Continue with Google" via Credential Manager → /auth/google is code-complete
  and degrades gracefully until `google_web_client_id` is set (mirrors iOS's
  inert GIDClientID). Owner-blocked (need config): Google sign-in web client id,
  Apple sign-in (Android web-OAuth flow, not yet built), Play Billing (Play
  Console products), FCM push (Firebase project).
  UI/quality round 2026-07-06 (emulator-verified, pushed to main): referenced the
  iOS design system directly — content cards now load real `image_url` photos via
  Coil (iOS's AsyncImage-with-gradient-fallback pattern); photographic `HeroCard`s
  on Home/Journal/Sleep; Talk chat bubbles; a design-system pass (`Modifier.glass`
  cards, gradient `PrimaryButton`, filled `PickChip`, styled `AppTextField`,
  nav-bar selected pill + hairline). First automated Android tests: `SessionTest`
  (6 — auth/refresh/offline-cache, incl. the network-blip-no-signout fix) +
  `ScreenLogicTest` (6 — sleep math, greeting, parsers), via injectable Store/http
  seams on `Session` + `internal` screen logic; CI Android job now runs
  `:app:testDebugUnitTest` before assemble. Accessibility: labeled play/pause +
  voice-orb controls, ≥48dp `PickChip` targets — full TalkBack/real-device audit
  tracked in [ANDROID_QA.md](ANDROID_QA.md). Deps added: `coil-compose`.
  Release-readiness round 2026-07-06: the release build is verified for the first
  time (`assembleRelease` + `bundleRelease` green → `app-release.aab`, unsigned
  pending the owner's upload key); privacy-hardened for Play (`allowBackup="false"`
  + `data_extraction_rules` exclude the refresh token + personal-data cache from
  cloud backup AND device transfer; release stays HTTPS-only with the prod API
  baked in). Play submission runbook + Data-Safety mapping + owner checklist in
  [ANDROID_RELEASE.md](ANDROID_RELEASE.md). R8 minify ENABLED 2026-07-07
  (+ resource shrinking): APK 13.3 MB → 2.5 MB (−81%); emulator-smoked on a
  debug-signed release build (launch → funnel → auth incl. inert Google path,
  zero AndroidRuntime errors) — owner repeats the QA pass on a real device
  before Play upload. Regulatory-parity round 2026-07-07 (top-3 gaps from a
  fresh iOS↔Android audit, all emulator-verified live against the dev backend):
  (1) DPDP consent-notice i18n — `ui/screens/ConsentNotice.kt` (13 languages,
  third copy of the cross-stack contract) + notice-language picker on the
  onboarding consent step AND Privacy & memory (हिन्दी/தமிழ் re-render
  verified); fixed en route: Android had 4 consent toggles PRE-TICKED —
  now everything defaults off (private-by-default parity with iOS/web);
  (2) persistent AI-disclosure pill on Talk + details dialog + 3 h periodic
  re-show (mirrors iOS AIDisclosure); (3) crisis banner on Talk when a reply
  carries the `crisis` suggestion action (sticky, → Crisis screen — verified
  end-to-end: risky message → live safety scan → banner → 112 screen).
  Unit tests 12→16 (crisis detection, notice mapping/fallback, 13×6 contract
  shape). Parity batch 2 (2026-07-07, all emulator-verified live): forgot-
  password ("Forgot password?" → /auth/password/forgot — reset link confirmed
  in api logs); conversation starters on empty Talk (POST /assessment/topics →
  chips; live LLM topics rendered + tapped); Talk "Save this conversation to
  my journal" (→ /journal, entry confirmed in History); journal search (local
  title/body filter, shows at >3 entries); first-party analytics
  (`net/Analytics.kt`: anon install id + opt-out toggle in Privacy & memory,
  onboarding_step/onboarding_done/paywall_view — funnel steps mapped to the
  canonical cross-stack names; verified rows in `product_events` incl.
  welcome/age_gate/disclosure + paywall_view). Found+fixed a real backend bug:
  `/events` `source` pattern rejected `android` with 422 (predated the client)
  — pattern extended + test pinned. Unit tests 16→23. Oracle round (2026-07-07):
  Talk now upgrades to the streaming agentic Oracle when the server has it
  (`Session.sse` — HttpURLConnection SSE with the same refresh-rotation
  semantics as `api()`, seam-tested; deterministic /chat stays the fallback):
  token streaming bubble, inline `widget` frames → `WidgetCard` (breathing/
  grounding→Games, mood_check→Home, mini_journal→Journal, sleep_checkin→Sleep,
  else honest iOS-only note — third copy of the widget-kinds contract),
  `tool_confirm` → Approve/Not-now card → `/oracle/confirm` resumes the same
  thread, `crisis` frames raise the existing banner. Emulator-verified LIVE:
  real LLM stream → "5-4-3-2-1 grounding" widget card → Open→Games; "log my
  mood as anxious" → interrupt card → Approve → resumed stream → mood row in
  Postgres. Unit tests 23→29 (SSE line parse, frame order, 401-rotation
  replay, error-detail surfacing, widget parse/route). Final parity batch
  (2026-07-07, all emulator-verified live): contextual baseline (Home row at
  ≥3 real check-ins → two 1–5 scales, local-only via the Store seam, first
  save wins the date → Insights "Your starting point" card); journal lock
  (androidx.biometric behind a Privacy toggle — graceful unlock with no
  screen lock enrolled, AND the real device-credential prompt verified with
  an emulator PIN); sleep favourites (heart per row + Favourites section,
  keyed by title) + sleep auto-stop timer (NowPlaying chip off→15→30→45→60
  min; AmbientService fades ~10 s then stops); 5 new calm games — Memory
  match, Pattern glow, Zen ripples, Bubble wrap, Gratitude garden
  (persisted) — the Games hub now has 8 activities (iOS-hub parity). Unit
  tests 29→34. **The iOS↔Android parity list is CLOSED.** Still honestly
  blocked on the content pipeline (not code): sound mixing + per-track
  narrated audio need multiple real audio assets; Health Connect stays
  deferred-heavy.
- [x] Check-in ritual reward — 2026-07-04: saving a mood check-in now offers
  "A tiny reward — seal it with a 1-minute calm game" (routes to Games; offered,
  never forced). The proactive ritual itself was already the Home hero + daily
  reminder.
- [x] Prompt registry — 2026-07-07: versioned, admin-editable LLM prompts.
  `prompt_templates` (Alembic `f61b3d8e4c92`; immutable versions per name, one
  active) + `services/prompts.py` (modules register code defaults at import;
  call sites read `await prompts.get(name)` — active row overrides, any miss or
  DB error falls back to the default so the LLM path can't break). All four
  prompts wired: `agentic_plan`, `safety_classifier`, `assessment_topics`,
  `oracle_system` (the Oracle node re-reads per turn — edits apply without a
  graph rebuild). Admin: `/admin/prompts` (list/save/activate/revert) + a
  "Prompts" dashboard tab (edit → new version, rollback, revert to code
  default). Prompt changes reach production without a deploy.
- [ ] Content depth + clinical credibility (SHIP_READINESS.md "honest gaps").
- [x] `mcp.cerebrozen.in` — dropped 2026-07-04 (dangling subdomain removed from
  the Caddyfile comment; owner: delete the DNS record).
- [x] CSP — 2026-07-04: pragmatic policy in the shared Caddy snippet (blocks
  remote scripts/objects/frames/images, pins connect-src to our origins;
  'unsafe-inline' script/style stayed for Next hydration). Superseded 2026-07-07
  by the per-app nonce middleware (next item).
- [x] CSP nonce upgrade — 2026-07-07: per-app `middleware.ts` (hand-duplicated
  across apps/web+admin+app like the token blocks) issues a per-request script
  NONCE — `script-src 'self' 'nonce-…'`, no 'unsafe-inline' scripts (styles keep
  it — Next injects inline styles); `worker-src 'self'` pinned so /sw.js can't
  break; `connect-src` derives from `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` (dev/e2e/prod). Root
  layouts force dynamic rendering (prerendered HTML can't carry a fresh nonce;
  nothing used static output — the landing trades static optimization away
  deliberately). `next dev` keeps a relaxed policy (react-refresh needs eval).
  Caddy: CSP removed from the shared snippet (apps' headers pass through);
  the API block gets `default-src 'none'` defense-in-depth. Also fixed:
  apps/app Dockerfile now copies `public/` (the Web Push sw.js 404'd in
  container builds). Verified: e2e green against production builds with
  Chromium ENFORCING the nonce policy; headers + nonce-attr match curl-checked.

## Done — implementation pass 2026-07-02

### P0 (verified)
- [x] **Oracle durable checkpointing** — `AsyncPostgresSaver` on the app DB (MemorySaver
  only as logged dev fallback); paused confirmations now survive restarts and cross
  gunicorn workers. Verified live: SSE streams + "Oracle checkpointer: Postgres" boot log.
- [x] **Nudge delivery scheduler** — in-process asyncio loop in `app.main` lifespan every
  `NUDGE_DISPATCH_INTERVAL_MINUTES` (default 5, 0 = external cron); `dispatch_due` claims
  rows `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` so multi-worker/cron passes never double-send.
- [x] **App Store receipt pinning** — Apple Root CA-G3 PEM bundled at
  `backend/app/certs/`, prod template points at it, and `verify_transaction` now rejects
  transactions whose `bundleId` isn't ours (tests added).
- [x] **Admin UI credential leak** — seeded-creds prefill + hint gated to dev builds.
- [x] **Caddy security headers** — shared snippet (HSTS, nosniff, SAMEORIGIN,
  Referrer-Policy, Permissions-Policy) imported into all three site blocks.
- [x] **Rate limits on expensive endpoints** — `/chat` 30/min, `/oracle/*` 30/min,
  `/voice/stt` 20/min, `/voice/tts` 60/min, `/waitlist` 10/min; limiter now keys on
  `X-Forwarded-For` behind Caddy.
- [x] **Oracle error frames** — generic client message; real exception server-logged.

### P1
- [x] SIWA entitlement file + `CODE_SIGN_ENTITLEMENTS` wired (build verified).
- [x] Privacy-label tables reconciled (SHIP_READINESS now matches PRIVACY_LABELS: no
  analytics, no diagnostics).
- [x] Stale URLs — SHIP_READINESS support/marketing → cerebrozen.in; iOS privacy link
  fixed; new `apps/web/app/support/page.tsx` (+ sitemap/footer).
- [x] Pricing aligned — paywall renders StoreKit `displayPrice`; `Products.storekit` set
  to Indian storefront ₹499/₹1,499; fallbacks consistent.

### P2
- [x] Quota window is midnight-UTC (was rolling 24 h); test pins the boundary.
- [x] `dispatch_due` outcomes honest: `skipped` (no token) / `failed` (push error) instead
  of fake `sent` — queryable dead-letter, no silent drops.
- [x] Apple private-relay/no-email sign-in — `users.apple_sub` column (migration
  `8c7f5d1b9e46`), lookup by stable `sub` first, synthesized address when Apple withholds
  email, legacy accounts adopt the sub.
- [x] `prestart` fails loudly in production when migrations fail (create_all fallback is
  dev-only).
- [x] JWKS caches (Apple + Google) refresh on a 6 h TTL.
- [x] Web/admin typecheck in CI (`tsc --noEmit` job; committed `next-env.d.ts`). No ESLint
  config exists, so no lint step.
- [x] Accessibility pass — VoiceOver labels/traits on all game tap targets, slider values
  on sleep volume/timer, journal/safety field labels.
- [x] Admin "Dispatch due nudges" button on Overview (manual pass alongside the scheduler).
- [x] Waitlist spam — hidden honeypot field client-side + 10/min IP rate limit server-side.
- [x] Transaction ownership — reviewed: services `flush()`, routes `commit()`; the flagged
  double-commit did not exist (dispatch_due commits by design — it's a job, not a route).

Verification: backend **177 passed, 95% coverage** (in-container, live Postgres); web +
admin `tsc --noEmit` clean; iOS `xcodebuild build` succeeded with the new entitlement.
